# Compatibility_Quiz

###Concept
A quiz that contains a variety of questions (10 in total) that the user can provide an answer to on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). User answers are added up, and the user with the closest total score of answers is given as a 'match' as the most compatible other user on the app. 

###About the project
This project contains a main server file, as well as routing files for HTML routes (for displaying pages of the app) and API routes (for getting/posting data on each user's responses + match). 

This app is built using Node.js (and the _express_ and _path_ packages) for the backend, front end JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and the JQUery library. The live version of the app is hosted on Heroku.
